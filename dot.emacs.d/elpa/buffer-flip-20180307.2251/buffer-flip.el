Buffer-flip has been updated and its old configuration is being
phased out.  Change your configuration as follows for an updated
configuration with your current key bindings.


%s


The above code has automatically been run so buffer-flip should
continue to work with the same key bindings as before, but you
will continue to see this message on startup until you update
your configuration as shown above.

Sorry for the inconvenience.  The main reason for the change is
to add support for normal (non-chord) key bindings.  Backwards
compatibility with old configuration will be removed in a future
version.
