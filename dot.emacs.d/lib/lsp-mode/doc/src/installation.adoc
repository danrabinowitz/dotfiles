== Installation

`lsp-mode` is available as a package on both http://melpa.org/[MELPA] and
http://stable.melpa.org/[MELPA Stable]. If you haven't added either to
Emacs' package sources, you can do that with

[source,elisp]
----
(require 'packages)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
----
For MELPA, or
[source,elisp]
----
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
----
for MELPA Stable.

After updating the package list with `M-x package-refresh-contents RET`,
you can install `lsp-mode` using `M-x package-install RET lsp-mode RET`.

=== Installing language servers

Because language servers exist outside of Emacs, they need to be
installed seperately. A list of language servers is available at
https://langserver.org/ and
https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/servers/.
Additionally, this documentation also provides a
xref:lang-support[list of supported languages].
